# The Moon Is Distant From The Sea
## *Emily Elizabeth Dickinson*

:moon::ocean:

The moon is distant from the sea, <br>
And yet with amber hands<br>
She leads him, docile as a boy<br>
Along appointed sands.<br>

He never misses a degree;<br>
Obedient to her eye,<br>
He comes just so far toward the town,<br>
Just so far goes away.<br>

Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand,<br>
And mine the distant sea,<br>
Obedient to the least command<br>
Thine eyes impose on me.<br>
